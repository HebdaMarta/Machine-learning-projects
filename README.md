It's a classifier with the LogisticRegression model. The data can be found here: _from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer_ Data are divided into a training and test set using the train_test_split method. The model is fitted in the training part and calculate the fit score to the data. The effectiveness of the model is checked by counting the score for the test part.
